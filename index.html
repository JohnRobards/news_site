      <p class="title">Will World of Warcraft Die Soon?</p>
      <p class="content">Every new expansion for Blizzard's titan MMO, WoW, ends up with the game losing more and more players. The trend seems to be
      that when a new expansion launches, the subscription numbers go up due to the excitement, and then after a few months people feel like they've experienced all that they
      wanted to in WoW again and so they quit playing. This has been happening since back in Cataclysm, through Mists of Pandaria, and most recently
      Warlords of Draenor. WoW now has somewhere in the neighbourhood of 5-6 million subscribers, which may seem like a lot, but is a sharp drop off from
      the days when it had over 10 million subscribers. Blizzard has been experimenting with new subscription models as a way to entice players
      back into the game, but it's had mixed success. All in all, WoW still won't be "dying" anytime soon, but if they don't change their model,
      or their next expansion isn't amazing, they'll keep bleeding subscribers for sure. WoW is still the best and most popular MMO around though.</p>

      <p class="title">Will Legion Make it Worthwhile to go Back to WoW? </p>
      <p class="content">Possibly? It really depends on why you left WoW in the first place. If you felt like you did everything in WoD, and you just didn't
      have any more content, then yes, Legion will introduce more content and thus be a great time for you to come back. However if you didn't like the direction WoW
      was taking or your just felt burnt out in general Legion may not be enough of a change to fix it. The new PvP system is probably the most
      exciting gameplay change, at least for the lategame. So, if PvP isn't really your thing, then Legion probably isn't worth it. If you want some more
      details about what else Legion will be changing, we encourage you to look below as they go into a lot more depth about all the little stuff.</p>

      <p class="content">Will we ever? Probably. Will it be within the next decade? Maybe. Are they working on it right now? Nothing indicates that they are,
      sadly. As an avid Warcraft III player, I'd love to see another RTS set in the warcraft universe with the custom map integration that III had. Blizzard
      just has no real reason to work on a Warcraft IV at the moment. They have so many other new products coming out, that are making them a lot more money
      than a new Warcraft RTS would. Warcraft IV would also be a direct competitor to Starcraft II, which just finished it's expansions. So, don't
      hold your breath for Warcraft IV, but it should come some day, given how popular WoW and Warcraft III were/are.</p>

      <p class="content">The Old Gods Expanions will be Hearthstone's third full card expansion, and it's themed around the Old gods corrupting cards
      from previous sets and giving them new ablities and stats. Of course there will be original cards, but the main focus seems to be around showcasing
      "corrupt" cards. With this new expansion, a new mode called standard will be introduced, in which older expansions and adventures will cycle out every few years,
      starting with Goblins Versus Gnomes cards and the Naxx adventure. All in all, the new expansion should come out sometime in April and the cards that they've been
      revealing make it seem very exciting!</p>

      <p class="title">Blizzard has Finally Released more Deck Slots, What Features Will they Add Next?</p>
      <p class="content">It's hard to say as Blizzard tends to not let the public know what they're working on until they're sure that it's going to be
      added and almost finished and with the next expansion coming up, Blizzard has their hands full finishing that up. In the past, Blizzard has expressed interest
      in adding a 2v2 mode and an achievment system, so those are two things to look forward to. The best bet for updates on what Blizzard is working on is
      to keep up with it's designers on twitter as they usually post the updates, especially Ben Brode, their lead designer.</p>

      <p class="content">Blizzard has stated that they are examining between 2-20 cards for nerfs in the upcoming update. They've cited Big Game Hunter,
      Savage Roar, Ancient of Lore, and Innvervate as very likely cards to receive a nerf, but other than that it's hard to say. They'll likely nerf some
      of the big minions, to help compensate for the Big Game Hunter nerf, especially the giants, but other than that it's hard to say. The list below provides a pretty
      good guess as any to likely nerf targets.</p>

      <p class="content">Starcraft II had it's final expansion release recently in the form of Legacy of the Void and with it Starcraft II's development cycle comes to an end.
      Is Blizzard's plan to release a Starcraft III in the near future or something else? They've talked about releasing a Nova Covert Ops story in
      chapters soon so that should be exciting but other than that it's hard to say what their plan is after that. They might create a Starcraft movie if the
      Warcraft one does well enough, isn't that exciting? I wouldn't expect any new big game for a couple of years at least though, as that's how Blizzard
      tends to operate.</p>

      is doing fairly little to support the competitive scene. Sadly Starcraft II doesn't seem to be on the come up like the first one was.</p>

      <p class="content">Hardcore Diablo II fans may say no, however Diablo III is a great game in it's own right. It may have taken a slightly different
      approach than Diablo II did, but Diablo III is no less fun. A lot of time has passed since 2000 and Diablo II's release, and game design has come a long way, so
      it makes sense that Diablo III is different. Diablo III is getting better and better as time goes on, and for me at least Diablo III is a great sequal to
      the great Diablo II and I could hardly be happier.</p>

      <p class="content">Blizzard is considering opening up a new movie studio if the WoW movie is successful enough, where they'll be able to produce
      movies for all of their franchises in beautiful Blizzard CGI. As a person who loves Blizzard's animation team, I strongly encourage everyone to go see
      the WoW movie just so that Blizzard will try and make more. Blizzard is so big at this point that they're trying to branch out into everything.</p>

      are over 20 million registered players for Heroes of the storm so it's fairly popular, to say the least. As far as Blizzard standards go though, it's been a bit underwhelming
      both in the number of players and in the profit made. They still support it so it clearly makes them enough to be worthwhile, but it wasn't the instant
      success they hoped it would be. The link below takes you to a leaked earning report for Heroes of the Storm a few months ago.</p>

      <p class="content">It doesn't really mean anything for Blizzard's other products. Blizzard has been trying their hand at basically making their own version
      of other very popular games that make a lot of money recently, and this is basically their version of TF2. It's kind of sad to see Blizzard trying
      something so different than their RTS roots, but they're a large company and are trying to find a game as successful as WoW was. Blizzard is large
      enough where they have seperate studios for Overwatch, so it doesn't take away from their other titles at all.</p>
