      <p class="title">Will World of Warcraft Die Soon?</p>
      <p class="content">Every new expansion for Blizzard's titan MMO, WoW, ends up with the game losing more and more players. The trend seems to be
      that when a new expansion launches, the subscription numbers go up due to the excitement, and then after a few months people feel like they've experienced all that they
      wanted to in WoW again and so they quit playing. This has been happening since back in Cataclysm, through Mists of Pandaria, and most recently
      Warlords of Draenor. WoW now has somewhere in the neighbourhood of 5-6 million subscribers, which may seem like a lot, but is a sharp drop off from
      the days when it had over 10 million subscribers. Blizzard has been experimenting with new subscription models as a way to entice players
      back into the game, but it's had mixed success. All in all, WoW still won't be "dying" anytime soon, but if they don't change their model,
      or their next expansion isn't amazing, they'll keep bleeding subscribers for sure. WoW is still the best and most popular MMO around though.</p>

      <p class="title">Will Legion Make it Worthwhile to go Back to WoW? </p>
      <p class="content">Possibly? It really depends on why you left WoW in the first place. If you felt like you did everything in WoD, and you just didn't
      have any more content, then yes, Legion will introduce more content and thus be a great time for you to come back. However if you didn't like the direction WoW
      was taking or your just felt burnt out in general Legion may not be enough of a change to fix it. The new PvP system is probably the most
      exciting gameplay change, at least for the lategame. So, if PvP isn't really your thing, then Legion probably isn't worth it. If you want some more
      details about what else Legion will be changing, we encourage you to look below as they go into a lot more depth about all the little stuff.</p>
